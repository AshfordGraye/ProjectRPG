# Bugs and Improvements List

## Improvements:
-    Items to be given based on role selected:
>   Soldier     - Arma Rifle - existing
>   Scientist   - Scanner - existing
>   Medic       - Arma Healing item of soome kind
>   Officer     - Arma Gauntlet - existing
>
>   The introduction character, Armish Cornwall, will gift the player the above items instead of the field dressing and knife he does now - the idea being he's carrying around an Armatek item he doesn't know how to use. 
 
-    For simplicity's sake, all references to the Field Droid will now be removed, as I wish to wrap this project up and move on to a C# based project. (Yay, my first cut character!)

Further improvements will be added as discovered and necessary
