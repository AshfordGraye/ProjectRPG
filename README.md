# ProjectRPG
## College Assignment Project

** Project RPG is a text-based adventure game in Python using Object Oriented Programming. You, the player, take on the role of a former soldier, seeking to take part in an underground fighting ring. **

Through a menu system that can be navigated using only numbers and the enter key, the following functionality has been implemented:
- Navigation
- NPC interaction
- Turn-based combat
- Item usage
- Weapon equipment

The game is presented by an unnamed Game Master, who provides the 'narration' of story elements and NPC dialogue.

> This project is technically 'finished', according to the project requirements. However, I intend to expand upon and improve the game's functionality and code over time to produce something more interesting.
